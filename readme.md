#Interview Challenges
This is the git repo for the Interview Challenges. Find more info on how to set up the AWS Cluster below.

##AWS Cluster set up

Go to http://aws.amazon.com/console/

Select 'Sign Up' in the top right hand corner. Follow the instructions to set up your account. Don't worry too much about the Billing info-- it's free for Micro servers which is what you'll be using for the challenges.

On your dashboard there will be the option to go to the EC2 Dashboard.

In this screen, select 'Launch Instance' [tip: if you're worried about being charged, select the 'Free tier only' option.]

Go to 'Community AMIs' and search for:
```
interviewchallenges - ami-bcb741cb
```

Make sure it's a Micro (should default to that) and Launch the Instance. Everything should be on the instance-- the data set, Pig, etc.
