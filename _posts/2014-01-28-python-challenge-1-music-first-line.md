Create a script that takes the phrase of a song and outputs it correctly punctuated.

e.g

## Song 1
```bash
echo 'should auld acquaintance be forgot, and never brought to mind? 
should auld acquaintance be forgot, and days of auld lang syne.' | python song.py
```
# Result
Should auld acquaintance be forgot, and never brought to mind?  
Should auld acquaintance be forgot, and days of auld lang syne.  

## Song 2
```bash
echo 'start spreading the news, I’m leaving today. 
i want to be a part of it - new york, new york. 
these vagabond shoes, are longing to stray right. 
through the very heart of it - new york, new york' | python song.py
```
# Result
Start spreading the news, I’m leaving today.  
I want to be a part of it - New York, New York.  
These vagabond shoes, are longing to stray.  
Right through the very heart of it - New York, New York.
